A fourth and a fifth subfields :code:`cfd_geometry` and :code:`3D_fem` will be added to support higher fidelity modeling of the rotor. All distributed quantities, such as blade chord or the thickness of a structural component, are expressed in terms of pair arrays :code:`grid` and :code:`values`, which must have a minimum length of two elements and the same size. :code:`grid` is defined nondimensional between 0 (root) and 1 (tip) along the, possibly curved, :code:`reference_axis`.

The two arrays must share the same length and to keep an airfoil constant along blade span, this must be defined twice. The :code:`labels` must match the :code:`names` of the airfoils listed in the top level :code:`airfoils`. In between airfoils, the recommended interpolation scheme for both coordinates and polars is the Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP), which is implemented in `Matlab <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pchip.html>`_ and in the Python library `SciPy  <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.PchipInterpolator.html>`_.

                                description: The sub-field :code:`layers` defines the material layers of the wind turbine blade. In most cases, these are layers of composite materials. The most convenient approach to define the position of spar caps mimics the definition of the shear webs, adding the width and side that define the width of the layer in meters and the side where the layer is located, either “pressure” or “suction”. Layers that wrap the entire cross section, such as paint or outer shell skin, can be defined with :code:`start_nd_arc` set to 0 and :code:`end_nd_arc` set to 1. To define reinforcements, the best way is usually to define the width, in meters, and the midpoint, named :code:`midpoint_nd_arc` and defined nondimensional between 0 and 1. Converters should be able to look for the leading edge, marked as LE. Similar combinations can be constructed with the combination of :code:`width` and :code:`start_nd_arc` or :code:`end_nd_arc`. Finally, for composite layers belonging to the shear webs, a tag :code:`web` should contain the name of the web. The layers are then modeled from leading edge to trailing edge in the order they were specified.

Unlike the joints defined in the global coordinate system in the :code:`joints` section of the ontology, these joints will change their absolute (x,y,z) location if the member diameter is altered the or :code:`joint1` or :code:`joint2` locations are changed during an optimization.  This is especially useful when designing a truss-like structure with pontoons attaching to primary members or columns in a semisubmersible. Like the joints above, these must be given a unique name.

For shear webs perpendicular to the chord line in the section(s) where twist is zero, it is easiest to simply use the keyword fixed :code:`twist`. Blades with straight shear webs will always have the field rotation equal to the twist plus/minus a constant angle and, assuming a non-swept blade (zero values in the blade y reference axis), a linear field offset.

The blade coordinate system is the one of `BeamDyn  <https://openfast.readthedocs.io/en/master/source/user/beamdyn/input_files.html#beamdyn-primary-input-file>`_ of OpenFAST and it is shown in the figure below. The consequences of this reference system is that standard wind turbine blades have positive twist inboard and close to zero or even slightly negative twist outboard, zero or negative x values for standard prebent blades, and positive y values for backward swept blades. The blade main direction is expressed along z, and total blade length must be computed integrating the fields x, y, and z three-dimensionally. For tower and moniopile, :code:`x` is parallel to the ground pointing downwind, :code:`y` is parallel to the ground and to the rotor plane, and :code:`z` is perpendicular to the ground pointing upwards. Standard monopiles are only defined along :code:`z`.
