Welcome to windIO's documentation!
==================================

.. only:: html

The repository defines two frameworks defining the inputs and outputs for systems engineering MDAO of wind turbine and plants. The github repository is `here <https://github.com/IEAWindSystems/windIO>`_.
The frameworks are implemented in two yaml-schemas, one for the turbine and one for the plant, to enforce an ontology of how data should be organized. The reference wind turbines and wind power plants designed within the IEA Wind Systems Engineering Task are checked against the schema through unit testing. You can access the yaml files at the following links `IEA onshore 3.4 MW  <https://github.com/IEAWindSystems/IEA-3.4-130-RWT/blob/master/yaml/IEA-3.4-130-RWT.yaml>`_, `IEA offshore 10.0 MW  <https://github.com/IEAWindSystems/IEA-10.0-198-RWT/blob/master/yaml/IEA-10-198-RWT.yaml>`_, `IEA floating 15.0 MW  <https://github.com/IEAWindSystems/IEA-15-240-RWT/blob/master/WT_Ontology/IEA-15-240-RWT.yaml>`_, `IEA 22-MW offshore <https://github.com/IEAWindSystems/IEA-22-280-RWT>`_, and `IEA Wind 740-10-MW Reference Offshore Wind Plants <https://github.com/IEAWindSystems/IEA-Wind-740-10-ROWP/blob/main/README.md>`_.

Supporting windIO in modeling software
--------------------------------------

The windIO data format is defined by the schemas included in this repository.
In order for a software to support windIO, it must support the data as described in the schemas
and use the included functions to validate the data.
windIO can be included as a dependency and installed as a package with pip.
The suggested method of incorporating windIO into your code is:

.. code-block:: python

   import windIO

   # Other code here

   windIO.validate(input="path/to/input.yaml", schema_type="plant/wind_energy_system <for example>")
   windIO.load_yaml("path/to/input.yaml")

   # Conversion to your software's data structures here
